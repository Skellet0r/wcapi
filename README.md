Webconnect COM Object wrapper

This package was made with the intent of wrapping the functions of the WebConnect. System object, in the wccom.dll file.

The object works in conjunction with the WebConnect Terminal Emulator which is a TN3270 emulator. This program is the main access point  
for many NYCDOE employees to the NYCDOE database.

This package utilizes the WebConnect COM object, which to my knowledge is only available for Windows OS, but is also difficult to find.
A work around is to download the Skedula DataExtractor installer, after running the exe and signing in once, you'll be prompted to download  
the WebConnect COM Object.
